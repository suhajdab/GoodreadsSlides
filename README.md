### A simple screensaver that takes a goodreads.com shelf rss feed and displays a wall of book covers.

Known issues, todos:
- the rss feed only contains 100 books max, so will have to implement some logic to fetch further pages
- need to add a configuration view to allow anyone to use their own shelf rss feed
- transitions
- shelf info improvement
